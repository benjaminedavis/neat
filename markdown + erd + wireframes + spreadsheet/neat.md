**neat**

This application will track the details of our (now 9 year old) whiskey club. The ultimate goal is to increase excitement and encourage more

Specifically it will feature the following:

- display the data points of each whiskey we try 
- allow members to make their own tasting notes
- details whiskeys and member attendence at each event
- keeps track of membership details
- offer password-protection, as the club is for members only


**User Stories**

Members will visit the site to review the details of whiskeys I've tasted.

Members will visit the site to make comments on the whiskeys and to comment on other member's comments I've tasted at Events.

The administrator will visit the site to enter new whiskeys as new events take place.


**Models**

The application will be comprised of four models:

**User** - will track each member's details and offer password security

**Event** - will detail each event and which whiskeys were sampled

**Whiskey** - will detail each whiskey

**Comment** - will allow each member to make his individual tasting notes available to the rest of the group
